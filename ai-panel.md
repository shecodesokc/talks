\# 14  
How has Apricot AI tangibly changed the daily workflow for home health nurses, and what feedback have you received from those on the front lines? *(Apricot)*  

\# 15  
How do you see AI/ML shaping the future of personalized experiences within platforms like YouVersion, where content delivery has to balance global reach with individual relevance? *(YouVersion)*  

\# 16  
OASIS documentation is notoriously complex — how does the use of AI ensure compliance while also reducing errors? *(Apricot)*  

\# 17  
What opportunities or challenges arise when integrating AI/ML models into API-driven systems that must serve millions of requests reliably? *(YouVersion)*
